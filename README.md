Learning from simulated and unsupervised Images through Adversarial training

It has been said that a picture is worth a thousand words. A thousand pictures, however, is
becoming more and more common in the realm of data science. With the increase of size in modern
data sets, labeling and classifying raw data by human hand is inefficient and even improbable.
But how can the labeling of these large data sets be automated and what are scientist currently
surveying via Generated Adversarial Networks (GAN)? This project seeks to explore some of the
current implementations and surveys, as well as discuss a related implementation based on these
works.
